            <header>Sample Work</header>
            <section class="content">
                <ul class='work-list'>
                    <li><a href='https://rittenhouseclaridge.com/neighborhood/' target='_blank'>Map Filter</a>: Using both the Google Maps and Google Places API, I built a system where people can find points of interest on a map in real time. To test, scoll down to the map section and click the icons on the left.</li>
                    <li><a href='https://rittenhouseclaridge.flywheelsites.com/open-apts/' target='_blank'>Rittenhouse Claridge Apartment Finder</a>: Using real data, I dynamically display available units and their daily price. The clickable floors and units are also dynamically displayed based on the provided data.</li>
                    <li><a href='https://galmangroup.com/property/coopers-place/' target='_blank'>Galman Group Apartment Pricing</a>: Similar to the above, I'm using daily provided data to show a price range for available apartments. This company has many properties, so my script is finding the correct file to use, as well as parsing the XML to find the lowest and highest price for each available unit. This was my first professional script.</li>
                    <li><a href='../dice-roller/' target='_blank'>Dice Roller</a>: I play a lot of tabletop RPGs, and wanted to prototype a dice roller. This is a part of a larger project.</li>
                    <li><a href='../not-vrml/' target='_blank'>VR Demo</a>: Using a JavaScript framework called A-Frame, I built a simple VR Demo. 360 degree view, and works in VR headset. You can move around, and when you click the box, it will rotate.</li>
                    <li><a href='../initiative/' target='_blank'>Initiative Tracker</a>: Another prototype for a larger project. This sorts entries by a number, and allows you to remove them from the list. This is the very first thing I've ever written in JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
